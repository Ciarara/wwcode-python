#Variables - are like containers that allows us to store values/data. 

# integer - positive/negative whole numbers
num = 88 

# float /decimal - positive/negative numbers with decimal 
dec = 99.99 

#Boolean - True or False
is_wwc_great = True 
has_forever = False

#String - series of characters enclosed in single/double quotes
movie_title = 'superwoman'

#Let's print out their values

print(num, dec, is_wwc_great, has_forever, movie_title)

#Re-assignment of variables 


num = 100
has_Forever = True 
print(num, has_Forever)


#Let's change the value of variable num 
num = 500
print(num)


has_Forever = False
print(has_Forever)
